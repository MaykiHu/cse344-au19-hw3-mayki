I found that the service was a little spotty in terms of connection.
It could be that since it is a service offered in the public cloud
there would be many people who could be accessing at any one time
-cough- CSE 344 students trying to run queries along with many
other people trying to run on the cloud as well.  Given this,
I found that I really appreciated the ability to have a DBMS
so accessible to use and easy to learn/navigate with the tutorials.
Aside from the minor disconnects saying I need to reauthenticate,
even though the active directory authentification was going on,
or the network being unavailable or very, very, VERY slow at
times for no reason and then running in a couple seconds where
it took 1 minute one time.. it is quite nice.  I found when
I worked later in the night, I did not deal with any of the 
disconnects quite as frequently.  

Aside from accessibility and network disconnects, I am concerned
that as a public cloud and with the firewall settings that data
could be compromised without paying for additional security.
Fortunately, we are not using this DBMS thus far with any
personal, compromisable data.  I wonder how having all the
security perks would be like.  I really do, again, like the DBMS
minus the slight connectivity issues for its accessibility!
